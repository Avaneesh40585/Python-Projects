# Squirrel Fur Color Counter
A simple Python script that analyzes squirrel data and counts the number of squirrels by fur color.

## ðŸ“‹ How it works
- Reads data from `Squirrel_Data.csv`
- Counts squirrels by fur color (Gray, Cinnamon, Black)
- Saves the counts in a new file called `Squirrel_Count.csv`
