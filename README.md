## Installing Dependencies

To set up a project which requires a certain libraries which are not pre-installed on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Make sure you have Python and pip installed

Check if Python and pip are available by running:
```python
python –version 
python -m pip –version
```

If you don’t have Python or pip, download and install them from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

---

### 2. (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment

This keeps your project’s dependencies isolated from other Python projects.

```python
python -m venv venv
On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

### 3. Install the required dependencies

If your project has a `requirements.txt` file, install all dependencies with:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or, to install a specific package (replace `package-name` with the desired library):
```python
python -c “import package_name; print(‘Installed!’)”
```

---

You’re now ready to run the project!  
If you encounter any issues, please refer to the documentation for the specific library or open an issue in this repository.
